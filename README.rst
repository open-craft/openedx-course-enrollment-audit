Purpose
*******

This plugin optimizes the tracking and auditing of manual enrollments in Open edX courses by:

1. Parsing and storing JSON data from the ``reason`` field of the ``ManualEnrollment`` model.
2. Ensuring that each ``enrolled_email`` and ``course_id`` pair is unique.

Getting Started

--------------
.. code-block:: bash

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:open-craft/openedx-course-enrollment-audit.git

Deploying
=========

Native Installation
-------------------

To deploy this to an Open edX instance, include it in the ``EDXAPP_PRIVATE_REQUIREMENTS`` or ``EDXAPP_EXTRA_REQUIREMENTS`` variables.

Tutor Installation
------------------

To `install`_ this in the Open edX build, include it in the ``config.yml`` file using the ``OPENEDX_EXTRA_PIP_REQUIREMENTS`` variable.

You need to rebuild the Open edX image::

    tutor images build openedx

Documentation
*************

Usage
=====

You can inspect the records by importing the ``CourseEnrollmentAudit`` model in your Django shell:

.. code-block:: python

  from openedx_course_enrollment_audit.models import CourseEnrollmentAudit
  CourseEnrollmentAudit.objects.all()

Alternatively, you can access them directly from the database shell:

.. code-block:: sql

  ./manage.py lms dbshell
  SELECT * FROM openedx_course_enrollment_audit_courseenrollmentaudit;

Backfilling Existing Data
=========================

To backfill existing data from ``ManualEnrollmentAudit`` into ``CourseEnrollmentAudit``, run the following management command:

.. code-block:: bash

  python manage.py lms backfill_course_enrollment_audit

This command ensures that all existing manual enrollments are tracked and audited according to the plugin's logic.
